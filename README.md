# Weather_Apache_AirFlow_Astro_ETL_Pipeline
I recently learned to build ETL Pipelines in Apache AirFlow using a Weather API


I don't own any code or ideas in this project. All credit goes to https://github.com/krishnaik06. I used krishnaik06, YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_vQyMljDsE, as a way to learn. It breaks down ETL Pipelines and goes into the the theory of Data Engineering. 

For a more indepth break down, check out https://github.com/krishnaik06/ETLWeather?tab=readme-ov-file.
